  Abstract                 = {This paper demonstrates the application of Kriging based approximations to the aerodynamic shape optimisation of a transonic compressor rotor where multiple fidelities of analysis are available. An extension to the co-Kriging method is implemented, and attention is paid to the efficient construction of the approximate models. The initial data sample within each level of the model is selected using space-filling designs, and the covariance structure of the co-Kriging models is obtained using a maximum likelihood estimation based on gradient optimisation with adjoint functions. An efficient leave-one-out cross-validation method is used to estimate model accuracy and is used to guide initial model refinement. NOMENCLATURE $\eta$ P µ L isentropic efficiency pressure ratio regression model coefficients concentrated log likelihood ˙ m $\sigma$ 2 $\sigma$ y massflow rate scaling hyperparameter residual process variance prediction variance INTRODUCTION The performance of turbomachinery components is often assessed at the design stage using high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics solvers. Such solvers are computationally expensive in nature, and their use in design optimisation becomes infeasible for large design problems given a limited computational budget. This paper addresses the aerodynamic shape optimisation of a transonic compressor rotor on a limited computational budget. Kriging response surface models of the rotor performance measures are used as an inexpensive ap-proximation in place of direct solver calls. Kriging has found extensive use in the aerospace industry, providing a highly flexible method capable of representing complicated responses (Forrester et al., 2008). Given a strict computational budget, any global optimisation framework based on Kriging models must be able to cope with potentially sparse data sampling and high problem dimensions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation codes can often be run at different levels of complexity both in terms of the mathematical model being used, and in terms of the resolution of the computational grid. For example, a high-fidelity, slow solution can be obtained on a fine grid and a low-fidelity solution with a much faster computation time can be obtained on a coarse grid. Here, a multi-fidelity co-Kriging method based on the auto-regressive model of Kennedy and O'Hagan (2000) is described, where response surface models of the high-fidelity function are constructed from a combination of computationally expensive high-fidelity data and cheap low-fidelity data. Global response surface accuracy is improved by correlating densely sampled low-fidelity data with sparsely sampled high-fidelity data. Strategies for updating the Kriging models with new designs are outlined, 1},

  Abstract                 = {The Controls Middleware (CMW) project was launched over ten years ago. Its main goal was to unify middleware solutions used to operate CERN accelerators. An important part of the project, the equipment access library RDA, was based on CORBA, an unquestionable standard at the time. RDA became an operational and critical part of the infrastructure, yet the demanding run-time environment revealed some shortcomings of the system. Accumulation of fixes and workarounds led to unnecessary complexity. RDA became difficult to maintain and to extend. CORBA proved to be rather a cumbersome product than a panacea. Fortunately, many new transport frameworks appeared since then. They boasted a better design and supported concepts that made them easy to use. Willing to profit from the new libraries, the CMW team updated user requirements and in their terms investigated eventual CORBA substitutes. The process consisted of several phases: a review of middleware solutions belonging to different categories (e.g. data-centric, object-, and message-oriented) and their applicability to a communication model in RDA; evaluation of several market recognized products and promising start-ups; prototyping of typical communication scenarios; testing the libraries against exceptional situations and errors; verifying that mandatory performance constraints were met. Thanks to the performed investigation the team have selected a few libraries that suit their needs better than CORBA. Further prototyping will select the best candidate.},

  Abstract                 = {An unbiased stochastic estimator of tr(I-A), where A is the influence matrix associated with the calculation of Laplacian smoothing splines, is described. The estimator is similar to one recently developed by Girard but satisfies a minimum variance criterion and does not require the simulation of a standard normal variable. It uses instead simulations of the discrete random variable which takes the values 1, -1 each with probability 1/2. Bounds on the variance of the estimator, similar to those established by Girard, are obtained using elementary methods. The estimator can be used to approximately minimize generalised cross validation (GCV) when using discretized iterative methods for fitting Laplacian smoothing splines to very large data sets. Simulated examples show that the estimated trace values, using either the estimator presented here or the estimator of Girard, perform almost as well as the exact values when applied to the minimization of GCV for n as small as a few hundred, where n is the number ...},

  Abstract                 = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

This method, which is a particular case of cokriging, allows us to improve a surrogate model of a complex computer code using fast approximations of it. In particular, we focus on the case of a large number of code levels on the one hand and on a Bayesian approach when we have two levels on the other hand. The main results of this paper are a new approach to estimating the model parameters which provides a closed form expression for an important parameter of the model (the scale factor), a reduction of the numerical complexity by simplifying the covariance matrix inversion, and a new Bayesian modeling that gives an explicit representation of the joint distribution of the parameters and that is not computationally expensive. A thermodynamic example is used to illustrate the comparison between 2-level and 3-level cokriging.},

These objectives were successfully met by the development and exploitation of efficient multi-objective three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)-based surrogate-assisted optimization strategies. In order to assess the aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of both baseline and optimized geometries, coupled unsteady RANS (URANS) simulation and farfield prediction based on an integral Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings approach were then carried out.

Hierzu werden zun{\"{a}}chst verschiedene deterministische und stochastische Verfahren implementiert und auf ihre Funktionsf{\"{a}}higkeit verifiziert. Zun{\"{a}}chst werden nur die Hauptabmessungen des Verdichters optimiert. Die restlichen Gr{\"{o}}{\ss}en werden sukzessive hinzugenommen. Hierzu ist es notwendig, eine neue Geometriebeschreibung einzuf{\"{u}}hren. In weiteren Untersuchungen wird die Optimierung auf zus{\"{a}}tzliche Parameter wie Reaktionsgrad, Stufenarbeit usw. ausgeweitet. Zus{\"{a}}tzlich bleibt der Optimierungsprozess nicht auf den Auslegungspunkt beschr{\"{a}}nkt, sondern er wird auf weitere Betriebspunkte ausgedehnt. Anhand einfacher zwei- und mehrdimensionaler Testfunktionen wird in ersten Untersuchungen die Funktionsf{\"{a}}higkeit der erarbeiteten Optimierungsprogramme aufgezeigt. In diesem Zusammenhang erweisen sich die deterministischen Methoden, die dem Gradientenpfad folgen und zum Teil auch zus{\"{a}}tzliche Kr{\"{u}}mmungsinformationen auswerten, trotz des h{\"{o}}heren mathematischen Aufwandes als deutlich schneller. Im Anschluss an diese grundlegenden Arbeiten werden Untersuchungen zur Kopplung der Optimierungsmethoden mit dem Meridianstr{\"{o}}mungsmodell vorgestellt. Die Verbindung der aerodynamischen Rechnung mit der Optimierung erfolgt dabei durch eine Schnittstelle, {\"{u}}ber die zum einen die zu minimierende Zielfunktion und zum anderen der Vektor der Auslegungsparameter ausgetauscht werden. Um die in der Praxis wichtige M{\"{o}}glichkeit zu erhalten, auf einfachem Weg das Meridianstr{\"{o}}mungsverfahren zu ver{\"{a}}ndern und unterschiedliche Nebenbedingungen zu ber{\"{u}}cksichtigen, wurde ein Straffunktionsansatz zur Erfassung von Restriktionen gew{\"{a}}hlt.}

  Abstract                 = {An automatic differentiation tool is used to develop the adjoint code for a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics solver. Rather than using automatic differentiation to differentiate the entire source code of the computational fluid dynamics solver, we have applied it selectively to produce code that computes the flux Jacobian matrix and the other partial derivatives that are necessary to compute total derivatives using an adjoint method. The resulting linear discrete adjoint system is then solved using the portable, extensible toolkit for scientific computation. This selective application of automatic differentiation is the central idea behind the automatic differentiation adjoint (ADjoint) approach. This approach has the advantage that it is applicable to arbitrary sets of governing equations and cost functions, and that it is exactly consistent with the gradients that would be computed by exact numerical differentiation of the original solver. Furthermore, the approach is largely automatic, thus avoiding the lengthy development times usually required to develop adjoint solvers for partial differential equations. These significant advantages come at the cost of increased memory requirements for the adjoint solver. Derivatives of drag and lift coefficients are validated, and the low computational cost and ease of implementation of the method are shown.},

We recommend new `blocked' algorithms, based on differentiating the Cholesky algorithm DPOTRF in the LAPACK library, which uses `Level 3' matrix-matrix operations from BLAS, and so is cache-friendly and easy to parallelize. For large matrices, the resulting algorithms are the fastest way to compute Cholesky derivatives, and are an order of magnitude faster than the algorithms in common usage. In some computing environments, symbolically-derived updates are faster for small matrices than those based on differentiating Cholesky algorithms. The symbolic and algorithmic approaches can be combined to get the best of both worlds.},

  Abstract                 = {Flows in the first stages of axial compressors are subject to

a number of unsteady effects which are not generally taken into

account in standard investigations, e.g. transition under the influence

of impinging wakes as well as that of downstream potential

effects, or the influence of unsteady blade row interactions. For

numerical studies of these phenomena, usually, simplifications

are made to the test case in question. These simplifications include

domain scaling, quasi-unsteady modeling, or modeling assumptions

regarding boundary layer development, like wall functions;

and their impact on the final result can be quite high. This

paper is concerned with the investigation of unsteady blade row

interactions in a 4.5 stage research compressor without any of

these simplifications. To this end, the whole annulus of the first

two stages of the compressor was meshed and unsteady RANS

simulations were carried out at two different operating points.

Spatial and temporal resolutions were fine enough to allow the

investigation of transitional phenomena on the blade surface using

an integral multi-mode transition model. For each operating

point, one revolution was recorded after computations reached

a periodic state. Examination of the boundary layer parameters

shows that transition plays a considerable role for the first

two compressor stages which were investigated in more detail.

It was evident that the development of the blade boundary layer

depends not only on incoming wakes from upstream blade rows;

the precise transition location is also highly dependent on the

potential effect of downstream blade rows.},

In particular, rapid and continuous development in aerospace engineering demands that new design concepts be regularly proposed to meet goals for increased performance, robustness and safety while concurrently decreasing cost. To date, the majority of the e!ort in design optimization of {\#}uid dynamics has relied on gradient-based search algorithms. Global optimization methods can utilize the information collected from various sources and by di!erent tools. These methods o!er multi-criterion optimization, handle the existence of multiple design points and trade-o!s via insight into the entire design space, can easily perform tasks in parallel, and are often e!ective in "ltering the noise intrinsic to numerical and experimental data. However, a successful application of the global optimization method needs to address issues related to data requirements with an increase in the number of design variables, and methods for predicting the model performance. In this article, we review recent progress made in establishing suitable global optimization techniques employing neural-network-and polynomial-based response surface methodologies. Issues addressed include techniques for construction of the response surface, design of experiment techniques for supplying information in an economical manner, optimization procedures and multi-level techniques, and assessment of relative performance between polynomials and neural networks. Examples drawn from wing aerodynam-ics, turbulent di!user {\#}ows, gas{\}}gas injectors, and supersonic turbines are employed to help demonstrate the issues involved in an engineering design context. Both the usefulness of the existing knowledge to aid current design practices and the need for future research are identi"ed.},

  Abstract                 = {The current paper describes DLR's optimizer AutoOpti, the implementation of the metamodel " Kriging " as accelerating technique, and the process chain in the automated, multidisciplinary optimization of fans and compressors on basis of a recent full stage optimization of a highly loaded, transonic axial compressor. Methods and strategies for an aerodynamic performance map optimization coupled with a finite element analysis on the structural side are presented. The high number of 231 free design parameters, a very limited number of CFD simulations, and conflicting demands both within the aerodynamic requirements and between the disciplines are a challenging optimization task. To navigate such a multi-dimensional search space, metamodels have successfully been used as accelerating technique. Using four aerodynamic operating points at two rotational speeds allows adjusting a required stability margin and optimizing the working line performance under this constraint. The investigated compressor concept is a highly loaded transonic stage with a single row rotor and a tandem stator, designed for a very high total pressure ratio. A. Introduction ompressors for aircraft engines are constantly developed towards higher aerodynamic loading to reduce the installation length, weight, and number of parts with no degradation in efficiency. This leads to more complex geometries and consequently to more complex flow structures. An automated optimization approach is to be preferred in order to take advantage of new design freedoms, while reducing or at least maintaining development time. Automated optimization is also suggested by recent progress in simulation technologies in several fields such as steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD), structural and thermal finite element analysis (FEM). Moreover, processors have become increasingly powerful, and parallel computing on huge clusters can be considered state of the art technology for CFD and FEM applications. Thus, it has become possible to employ optimization methods in the design of various parts of heavy duty gas turbines and aircraft engines, even when calculations require large computational resources.

  Abstract                 = {The process of likelihood maximization can be found in many different areas of computational modelling. However, the construction of such models via likelihood maximization requires the solution of a difficult multi-modal optimization problem involving an expensive O(n3) factorization. The optimization techniques used to solve this problem may require many such factorizations and can result in a significant bottleneck. This article derives an adjoint formulation of the likelihood employed in the construction of a kriging model via reverse algorithmic differentiation. This adjoint is found to calculate the likelihood and all of its derivatives more efficiently than the standard analytical method and can therefore be used within a simple local search or within a hybrid global optimization to accelerate convergence and therefore reduce the cost of the likelihood optimization. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimizations involving high-fidelity simulations can become prohibitively expensive when an exhaustive search is employed. To remove this expense a surrogate model is often constructed. One of the most popular techniques for the construction of such a surrogate model is that of kriging. However, the construction of a kriging model requires the optimization of a multi-model likelihood function, the cost of which can approach that of the high-fidelity simulations upon which the model is based. The article describes the development of a hybridized particle swarm algorithm which aims to reduce the cost of this likelihood optimization by drawing on an efficient adjoint of the likelihood. This hybridized tuning strategy is compared to a number of other strategies with respect to the inverse design of an airfoil as well as the optimization of an airfoil for minimum drag at a fixed lift},

  Abstract                 = {Verdichter in Flugzeugtriebwerken bzw. station�re Gasturbinenverdichter$\backslash$nhaben die Aufgabe, das str�mende Medium gem�� den Anforderungen aus$\backslash$nden thermodynamischen Kreisprozessbetrachtungen m�glichst effizient$\backslash$nzu verdichten. Des Weiteren sollen die komplexen Str�mungsvorg�nge$\backslash$nin Verdichtergittern, welche aus Verdichtungsst��en resultieren oder$\backslash$ndurch Wirbel in den Randzonen induziert werden, durch eine gezielte$\backslash$nFormgebung der str�mungsf�hrenden Bauteile positiv beeinflusst werden.$\backslash$nIn modernen Entwurfssystemen stehen daf�r zahlreiche Designparameter$\backslash$nzur Gestaltung des jeweiligen Bauteils zur Verf�gung. Diese beeinflussen$\backslash$nsowohl den Ringraum als auch die Geometrie der einzelnen Schaufelbl�tter.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMathematische Optimierungsstrategien k�nnen diesen Designraum gezielt$\backslash$nnach optimalen Parameters�tzen absuchen um die Gestaltungsfreiheiten$\backslash$nin m�glichst effektiver Weise zu nutzen. Dabei kommt der Ber�cksichtigung$\backslash$nmehrerer Betriebspunkte im Kennfeld des Verdichters eine besondere$\backslash$nBedeutung zu. Die Tatsache, dass f�r eine anwendungsorientierte Verdichteroptimierung$\backslash$ndas Kennfeld und nicht ein einzelner Betriebspunkt Ber�cksichtigung$\backslash$nfinden muss, induziert bereits die Notwendigkeit mehrere Zielfunktionen$\backslash$nsimultan zu betrachten. Eine solche Mehrzieloptimierung wird im Allgemeinen$\backslash$nmit dem englischen Begriff Multi-Objective gekennzeichnet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDas gesamte in diesem Projekt entwickelte Programmpaket besitzt einen$\backslash$nmodularen Aufbau um die Implementierung von Modulen der Industriepartner$\backslash$nsowie die Implementierung zus�tzlicher Schnittstellen mit neuen Programmen$\backslash$nzu erleichtern. Diese werden sich zuk�nftig aus der wachsenden Anzahl$\backslash$nvon Forderungen aus weiteren Fachdisziplinen (z.B. Bauteilmechanik,$\backslash$nFertigung) ergeben. Die integrierte und automatisch �berwachte Prozesskette,$\backslash$nwelche f�r die aerodynamische Optimierung ben�tigt wird, besteht$\backslash$naus den Modulen: Schaufelerzeugung, geometrische Restriktionen, Netzerzeugung,$\backslash$nCFD, Post-processing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nHierbei sind unterschiedliche St�mungsl�ser (Mises, TRACE und Magelan)$\backslash$nintegriert worden. Die Ersatzmodelle (Kriging, Neuronale Netze) der$\backslash$nSimulationsverfahren sind ebenfalls vom eigentlichen Optimierer entkoppelte$\backslash$nModule, welche basierend auf einer aktuellen Datenbasis neue viel$\backslash$nversprechende Kandidaten erzeugen k�nnen, welche dann mittels der$\backslash$neigentlichen Prozesskette bewertet werden.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAls Optimierungsschale wird hier ein asynchroner Multi-Objective Algorithmus$\backslash$nverwendet welcher auf der Evolutionsstrategie basiert. Die Evolutionsstrategie$\backslash$nbedient sich dem Vorbild der Natur: Besonders erfolgreiche Individuen$\backslash$nk�nnen Ihre Gene vererben, w�hrend erfolglose Individuen dies nicht$\backslash$nk�nnen. Dadurch entwickelt sich eine Spezies �ber mehrere Generationen$\backslash$nweiter und passt sich der jeweiligen Umgebung immer besser an. Die$\backslash$nVererbung wird innerhalb dieser Strategie mittels mathematischer$\backslash$nOperatoren: Mutation, Crossover sowie Differential Evolution nachempfunden$\backslash$nund zum Erzeugen neuer Kandidaten genutzt. Eine solche Optimierung$\backslash$nhat den Vorteil lokale Minima �berwinden zu k�nnen und �u�erst robust$\backslash$ngegen�ber den mathematischen Eigenschaften der Zielfunktionen (Stetigkeit,$\backslash$nDifferenzierbarkeit) zu sein. Der gr��te Nachteil solcher stochastischen$\backslash$nVerfahren liegt in der relativ hohen Anzahl ben�tigter Simulationen$\backslash$nf�r den notwendigen Optimierungsfortschritt, so dass verschiedene$\backslash$nBeschleunigungsmethoden durch Nutzung von Ersatzmodellen wie Kriging$\backslash$nund Neuronale Netze in das Optimierungspaket implementiert wurden.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDie komplett dreidimensionale Berechnung der Str�mung in einem vielstufigen$\backslash$nAxialverdichter ist mit heutigen Rechnerleistungen in einem Optimierungssprozess$\backslash$nnicht umsetzbar, da jede einzelne CFD-Berechung kompletter mehrstufiger$\backslash$nKomponenten numerisch zu kostspielig ist. Eine alternative Strategie,$\backslash$nzur Ber�cksichtigung der ganzheitlichen Komponente innerhalb der$\backslash$nOptimierung, besteht in der gekoppelten Str�mungssimulation. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nDieser setzt sich aus einem 3D-Navier-Stokes-Verfahren zur L�sung$\backslash$nder Str�mung in einem Teilbereich des Verdichters und einer reibungsfreien$\backslash$naber verlustbehafteten Throughflow-Rechnung des Gesamtverdichters$\backslash$nzusammen. Zwischen den beiden Str�mungssimulationen m�ssen Str�mungsdaten$\backslash$nausgetauscht werden. Aus der Throughflow-Rechnung werden die Randbedingungen$\backslash$nf�r die 3D-Rechnung extrahiert. Im Gegenzug werden aus den Str�mungsdaten$\backslash$nder 3D-Rechnung die umfangsgemittelten radialen Verteilungen der$\backslash$nVerluste und Abstr�mwinkel f�r die Throughflow-Rechnung bestimmt.$\backslash$nHieraus ergibt sich ein iterativer Prozess welcher in konsistenten$\backslash$n2D und 3D Simulationsergebnissen resultiert. Durch die Kopplung der$\backslash$nbeiden Str�mungsrechnungen er�ffnen sich weitere Optionen zum Aufbau$\backslash$nder Zielfunktionen. Neben den Str�mungsgr��en der optimierten Gitter$\backslash$nk�nnen nun auch die das Gesamtverhalten beschreibenden Kenngr��en$\backslash$nin die Zielfunktionsformulierung integriert werden.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis provides a framework for the evaluation of first and higher-order derivatives and Taylor series expansions through large computer programs that contain numerical linear algebra (NLA) functions. It is a generalization of traditional algorithmic differentiation (AD) techniques in that NLA functions are regarded as black boxes where the inputs and outputs are related by defining equations. Based on the defining equations, structure-exploiting algorithms are derived. More precisely, novel algorithms for the propagation of Taylor polynomials through the QR, Cholesky,- and real-symmetric eigenvalue decomposition are shown. Recurrences for the reverse mode of AD, which require essentially only the returned factors of the decomposition, are also derived. Compared to the traditional approach where all intermediates of an algorithm are stored, this is a reduction from O(N{\^{}}3) to O(N{\^{}}2) for algorithms with O( N{\^{}}3) complexity. N denotes the matrix size. The derived algorithms make it possible to$\backslash$nuse existing high-performance implementations. A runtime comparison shows that the treatment of NLA functions as atomic can be more than one order of magnitude faster than an automatic differentiation of the underlying algorithm. Furthermore, the computational graph is orders of magnitudes smaller. This reduces the additional memory requirements, as well as the overhead, of operator overloading techniques to a fraction.},

  Abstract                 = {A general theory of steady three-dimensional flow of a nonviscous
fluid in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines having arbitrary hub
and casing shapes and a finite number of blades is presented, The
solution of the three-dimensional direct and inverse problem is obtained
by investigating an appropriate combination of flows on relative
stream surfaces whose intersections with a z-plane either upstream
of or some- where inside the blade row form a circular arc or a radial
line. The equations obtained to describe the fluid flow on these
stream surfaces show clearly the several approximations involved
in ordinary two-dimensional treatments. They also lead to a solution
of the three-dimensional problem in a mathematically two-dimensional
manner through iteration. The equation of continuity is combined
with the equation of motion in either the tangential or the radial
direction through the use of a stream function defined on the surface,
and the resulting equation is chosen as the principal equation for
such flows. The character of this equation depends on the relative
magnitude of the local velocity of sound and a certain combination
of velocity components of the fluid. A general method to solve this
equation by both hand and high-speed digital machine computations
when the equation is elliptic or hyperbolic is described. The theory
is applicable to both irrotational and rotational absolute flow at
the inlet of the blade row and at both design and off-design operations.}

  Abstract                 = {Cokriging is a statistical interpolation method for the enhanced prediction of a less $\backslash$nintensively sampled primary variable of interest with assistance of intensively sampled $\backslash$nauxiliary variables. In the geostatistics community it is referred to as two- or multi-variable $\backslash$nkriging. In this paper, a new cokriging method is proposed and used for variable-fidelity $\backslash$nsurrogate modeling of aerodynamic data obtained with an expensive high-fidelity CFD code, $\backslash$nassisted by data computed with cheaper lower-fidelity codes or by gradients computed with $\backslash$nan adjoint version of the high-fidelity CFD code, or both. A self-contained derivation as well $\backslash$nas the numerical implementation of this new cokriging method is presented and the $\backslash$ncomparison with the autoregressive model of Kennedy and O'Hagan is discussed. The $\backslash$ndeveloped cokriging method is validated against an analytical problem and applied to $\backslash$nconstruct global approximation models of the aerodynamic coefficients as well as the drag $\backslash$npolar of an RAE 2822 airfoil based on sampled CFD data. The numerical examples show $\backslash$nthat it is efficient, robust and practical for the surrogate modeling of aerodynamic data $\backslash$nbased on a set of CFD methods with varying degrees of fidelity and computational expense. $\backslash$nIt can potentially be applied in the efficient CFD-based aerodynamic analysis and design $\backslash$noptimization of aircraft.},
